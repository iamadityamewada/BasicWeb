1. typeof(data)
   typerof data
         - check data types of data
2. Method to convert string number to number 
     1. By using + or -
             console.log(+data + age) // convert into postive number
             console.log(-data + age) // convert into nagative number
     2. By using funcion 
            1.Number(age) if string is pass then return NaN
     3. By using another funcion 
            1. parseInt() return the int value from the string from starting 
            2. parseFloat() 
diff b/w let , var and const
3. var:-
      is a global scope variable
      support hoisting
   let:-
      is a blocks cope variable
   const:-  
      is a blocks cope variable
      cannot reasign the value     
                         
 Diff b/w undefined Nan and Null
 undefined 
      not define any value // when decalare a variable but not assign any value it will automatically send it to the top of file 
      type of undefined is undefined
 Null 
      define null value // it is a value
      type of null is object 
?? age; when directly assign the value  return refernce error ??need variable type or data to assign default var

Hositing 
      Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables,
       function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. 
      Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.     

?? if a vairable again declare inside a block it act as per the block 
                                   
Dynamic string or templete literals
      ` this templete litersl ${vairable}`

Compare Operator
!==   === match value and data types both // strict match
!=   == match value only not data types

?? Undefine + anything return NaN
Undefine + Undefine = NaN
NaN + anything return NaN
Undefined + NaN = NaN 
function by default return the undefined

closure function is concept in javascript in which inner function can access the declare variable
and funcion of a outer function even after the execution of outer function.

curing function is chain of returning functon.
setTimeOut = 
setInterval = execution of task again again after particular frquency
